# DjangoSimpleSite

This is just a try out project in which I hope to get some friends involved.

Sorry for the messy code :)

For the friends:
Here's a tutorial for the used module (Django): https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/install/
It starts with a quick install guide.

A good read to extend the tutorial might be Django's page on their django.contrib.auth.models file:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/contrib/auth/
